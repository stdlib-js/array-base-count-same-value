    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

# countSameValue

> Count the number of elements in an array that are equal to a specified value.

<!-- Package usage documentation. -->



<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
import countSameValue from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/array-base-count-same-value@v0.2.0-esm/index.mjs';
```

#### countSameValue( x, value )

Counts the number of elements in an array that are equal to a specified value.

```javascript
var x = [ 0, 1, 0, 1, 2 ];

var out = countSameValue( x, 1 );
// returns 2
```

In contrast to an implementation using the strict equality operator `===`, the function distinguishes between `+0` and `-0` and treats `NaNs` as the same value.

```javascript
var x = [ NaN, NaN, NaN ];

var out = countSameValue( x, NaN );
// returns 3
```

## Notes

-   The function uses the [SameValue Algorithm][@stdlib/assert/is-same-value] as specified in ECMAScript 5.
